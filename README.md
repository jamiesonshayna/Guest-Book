IT305 Guest Book Project with Admin Page Data Tables

This project allows a "guest" to complete a form to digitally sign themselves into the book.
The form has normal user information fields, and validates on the client and the server.
Once the guest's information has been verified we insert their data into a database table,
and allow our Admin to view the entries on a separate page via a login portal.
